# Introduction
The goal of the project is to help a newly opened analyze the usage patterns and demand for the clubâ€™s facilities. The database provided consists of three datasets including member, facility and booking information. In this project, we will use SQL (Structured Query Language), a specialized language to access and manipulate databases.
# SQL Quries

### Table Setup (DDL)

Table 'cd.members' contains club member information including unique member id, name of the member, address, phone number and the time they joined the club and their recommenders if applicable. Member ID may not be sequential.
```
CREATE TABLE cd.members
    (
       memid integer NOT NULL, 
       surname character varying(200) NOT NULL, 
       firstname character varying(200) NOT NULL, 
       address character varying(300) NOT NULL, 
       zipcode integer NOT NULL, 
       telephone character varying(20) NOT NULL, 
       recommendedby integer,
       joindate timestamp NOT NULL,
       CONSTRAINT members_pk PRIMARY KEY (memid),
       CONSTRAINT fk_members_recommendedby FOREIGN KEY (recommendedby)
            REFERENCES cd.members(memid) ON DELETE SET NULL
    );
```
The facilities table lists all the bookable facilities that the country club possesses. The club stores id/name information, the cost to book both members and guests, the initial cost to build the facility, and estimated monthly upkeep costs. 
```  
 CREATE TABLE cd.facilities
    (
       facid integer NOT NULL, 
       name character varying(100) NOT NULL, 
       membercost numeric NOT NULL, 
       guestcost numeric NOT NULL, 
       initialoutlay numeric NOT NULL, 
       monthlymaintenance numeric NOT NULL, 
       CONSTRAINT facilities_pk PRIMARY KEY (facid)
    );
```
The table 'cd.bookings' tracks bookings of facilities. This table includes information about the member who made the booking, the start of the booking, and how many 'slots' the booking was made for.
```
  CREATE TABLE cd.bookings
    (
       bookid integer NOT NULL, 
       facid integer NOT NULL, 
       memid integer NOT NULL, 
       starttime timestamp NOT NULL,
       slots integer NOT NULL,
       CONSTRAINT bookings_pk PRIMARY KEY (bookid),
       CONSTRAINT fk_bookings_facid FOREIGN KEY (facid) REFERENCES cd.facilities(facid),
       CONSTRAINT fk_bookings_memid FOREIGN KEY (memid) REFERENCES cd.members(memid)
    );
```
### SQL Practices
###### Question 1: The club is adding a new facility - a spa. We need to add it into the facilities table. 
###### Use the following values: facid: 9, Name: 'Spa', membercost: 20, guestcost: 30, initialoutlay: 100000, monthlymaintenance: 800. 
```
insert into cd.facilities 
(
  facid, name, membercost, guestcost, 
  initialoutlay, monthlymaintenance
) 
values 
  (9, 'spa', 20, 30, 100000, 800);
```
###### Question 2: Let's try adding the spa to the facilities table again. This time, though, we want to automatically generate the value for the next facid, rather than specifying it as a constant. 
```
insert into cd.facilities 
values 
  (
    (select max(facid) from cd.facilities) + 1, 
    'spa', 20, 30, 100000, 800
  );
```
###### Question 3:We made a mistake when entering the data for the second tennis court. The initial outlay was 10000 rather than 8000: you need to alter the data to fix the error.
```
update 
  cd.facilities 
set 
  initialoutlay = 10000 
where 
  facid = 1;
```  
###### Question 4: We want to alter the price of the second tennis court so that it costs 10% more than the first one. Try to do this without using constant values for the prices, so that we can reuse the statement if we want to.
```
update 
  cd.facilities 
set 
  membercost = 1.1* (select membercost from cd.facilities where facid =0),
  guestcost = 1.1* (select guestcost from cd.facilities where facid=0)
where 
  facid = 1;
```  
###### Question 5: As part of a clearout of our database, we want to delete all bookings from the cd.bookings table. 
```
delete from cd.bookings;
```
###### Question 6: We want to remove member 37, who has never made a booking, from our database. 
```
delete from 
  cd.members 
where 
  memid = 37
```
###### Question 7: How can you produce a list of facilities that charge a fee to members, and that fee is less than 1/50th of the monthly maintenance cost? Return the facid, facility name, member cost, and monthly maintenance of the facilities in question.
```
select 
  facid, name, membercost, monthlymaintenance 
from 
  cd.facilities 
where 
  membercost < monthlymaintenance / 50 
  and membercost != 0
```
###### Question 8: How can you produce a list of all facilities with the word 'Tennis' in their name?
```
select * from cd.facilities 
where name like '%Tennis%'
```
###### Question 9: How can you retrieve the details of facilities with ID 1 and 5? Try to do it without using the OR operator.
```
select * from cd.facilities
where facid in (1,5)
```
###### Question 10: How can you produce a list of members who joined after the start of September 2012? Return the memid, surname, firstname, and joindate of the members in question.
```
select
  memid, surname, firstname, joindate
from
  cd.members 
where
  joindate >= '2012-09-01'
```
###### Question 11: You, for some reason, want a combined list of all surnames and all facility names. Yes, this is a contrived example :-).
```
select 
  distinct surname as surname 
from 
  cd.members 
union 
select 
  distinct name 
from 
  cd.facilities
```
###### Question 12: How can you produce a list of the start times for bookings by members named 'David Farrell'?
```
select 
  starttime 
from 
  cd.bookings 
  inner join cd.members on members.memid = bookings.memid 
where 
  firstname = 'David' 
  and surname = 'Farrell'
``` 
###### Question 13: How can you produce a list of the start times for bookings for tennis courts, for the date '2012-09-21'? Return a list of start time and facility name pairings, ordered by the time.
```
select
  bookings.starttime as start, facilities.name as name
from
  cd.bookings
inner join
  cd.facilities 
on
  facilities.facid=bookings.facid
where
  facilities.name in ('Tennis Court 2','Tennis Court 1') 
and
  bookings.starttime::date = '2012-09-21'
order by starttime
```
